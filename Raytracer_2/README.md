## Changes made in raytracer source files:
We used our Raytracer 1 code and made the following changes:
In the object header file a pure virtual function "pointMapping" was added to map a point in 3D to 2D coordinates. We implemented this function in the class Sphere.
A trivial implementation of pointMapping is added to the classes quad, plane and triangle. This was the only thing changed in those classes.

To the class "Scene" some setters for additional data were added, e.g. Shadows. We changed the method "render" such that it supports supersampling. We do this by shooting multiple rays at one pixel and taking the mean of the colors we get from these rays. We added a function "getClosest", which returns the first object that the ray hits. This function helps us with computing shadows. We added the variable reflectionDepth to the method "trace" to be able to compute the reflectionColor recursively.

In the class "Raytracer", we added an argument string ifname to be able to find the right directory in the method parseMaterialNode for the given texture. We suppose this is in the same directory as the json file given for the scene. Also, in Raytracer we need to read “Shadows”, “MaxRecursionDepth”, “SuperSamplingFactor” and a texture if they are given. The first three we try to read in the method readScene and the texture we look for in the method parseMaterialNode.

For performance reasons:
We added a statement "#pragma omp parallel for" to the method "render" to make it faster. However, the -fopenmp flag was not yet added to the makefile due to difficulties with macOS and omp.
Also in the method trace in the class "Scene" we made the variable material point towards the material of the object instead of copying the material. This has as advantage that, for every ray, the complete texture is not copied, which is quite expensive.

# Raytracer C++ framework for Introduction to Computer Graphics

This is a C++ framework for a raytracer. It is created for the Computer
Science course "Introduction to Computer Graphics" taught at the
University of Groningen.

This framework is inspired by and uses (some) code of the raytracer framework of
Bert Freudenberg which unfortunately is no longer available.

## Compiling the code

We provided a [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) file to be used with `cmake`.
This can be used in the following way (on the command line/shell):
```
# cd into the main directory of the framework
mkdir build   # create a new build directory
cd build      # cd into the directory
cmake ..      # creates a Makefile
# Comipiling the code can then be done with:
make
# or
make -j4      # replacing 4 with the number of cores of your pc
```
**Note!** After adding new `.cpp` files (when adding new shapes)
`cmake ..` needs to be called again or you might get linker errors.

## Running the Raytracer
After compilation you should have the `ray` executable.
This can be used like this:
```
./ray <path to .json file> [output .png file]
# when in the build directory:
./ray ../Scenes/scene01.json
```
Specifying an output is optional and by default an image will be created in
the same directory as the source scene file with the `.json` extension replaced
by `.png`.

## Description of the included files

### Scene files
* `Scenes/*.json`: Scene files are structured in JSON. If you have never
    worked with json, please see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Data_types,_syntax_and_example)
    or [here](https://www.json.org/).

    Take a look at the provided example scenes for the general structure.
    You are free (and encouraged) to define your own scene files later on.

### The raytracer source files (Code directory)

* `main.cpp`: Contains main(), starting point. Responsible for parsing
    command-line arguments.

* `raytracer.cpp/.h`: Raytracer class. Responsible for reading the scene
    description, starting the raytracer and writing the result to an image file.

* `scene.cpp/.h`: Scene class. Contains code for the actual raytracing.

* `image.cpp/.h`: Image class, includes code for reading from and writing to PNG
    files.

* `light.h`: Light class. Plain Old Data (POD) class. Colored light at a
    position in the scene.

* `ray.h`: Ray class. POD class. Ray from an origin point in a direction.

* `hit.h`: Hit class. POD class. Intersection between an `Ray` and an `Object`.

* `object.h`: virtual `Object` class. Represents an object in the scene.
    All your shapes should derive from this class. See

* `shapes (directory/folder)`: Folder containing all your shapes.

* `sphere.cpp/.h (inside shapes)`: Sphere class, which is a subclass of the
    `Object` class. Represents a sphere in the scene.

* `example.cpp/.h (inside shapes)`: Example shape class. Copy these two files
    and replace/rename **every** instance of `Example` `example.h` or `EXAMPLE`
    with your new shape name.

* `triple.cpp/.h`: Triple class. Represents a 3-dimensional vector which is
    used for colors, points and vectors.
    Includes a number of useful functions and operators, see the comments in
    `triple.h`.
    Classes of `Color`, `Vector`, `Point` are all aliases of `Triple`.

* `objloader.cpp/.h`: Is a similar class to Model used in the OpenGL
    exercises to load .obj model files. It produces a std::vector
    of Vertex structs. See `vertex.h` on how you can retrieve the
    coordinates and other data defined at vertices.

### Supporting source files (Code directory)

* `lode/*`: Code for reading from and writing to PNG files,
    used by the `Image` class.
    lodepng is created by Lode Vandevenne and can be found on
    [github](https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng).
* `json/*`: Code for parsing JSON documents.
    Created by Niels Lohmann and available under the MIT license on
    [github](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).
    **Recommended:** Especially take a look at their README for more
    info on how to work with json files.
