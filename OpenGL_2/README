We have implemented normal shading, gouraud shading and phong shading.
We also implemented the controls for choosing a shading mode.
In mainview.cpp we have added three functions, paintPhong, paintGouraud, paintNormal, for using the correct shader and the relating uniforms.

We also implemented the texture for the cat.
For this we have added the function loadTexture and added the given function imageToBytes to mainview.cpp.

Unforturnately, we did not have the time to compare compare different wrapping and filter methods.
