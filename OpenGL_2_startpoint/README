We have implemented normal shading, gouraud shading and phong shading.
We also implemented the controls for choosing a shading mode.
We attempted to implement textures. However, we ran into some difficulties.
When we used the sampler2D, instead of giving our cat a texture, the cat disappeared.
Therefore we have commented this line in the phong fragment shader.
Unforturnately, this means we cannot compare different wrapping and filter methods
