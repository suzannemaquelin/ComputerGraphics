This is a README file

When submitting your assignment, describe (briefly) the changes you made and what difficulties you encountered in this file.

Also describe what controls (key short-cuts, mouse clicks, mouse movement etc) and possible bonus assignments you implemented, so we can check them more easily.

If you have any suggestions/feedback for improving the practical assignments or support from teaching assistants, you may include it here OR post in anonymously on Nestor under Feedback.

For this lab, we added 3 objects, namely a cube, a pyramid and a sphere. 
We translated these objects using transformation matrices.
We added the controls for scaling and rotation.

Unfortunately, we were not able to get the right perspective using a projection matrix.
Therefore, when we translate the objects to the given coordinates they dissapear from view.
We have decided to make other translations which lie within view in order to show we are able to do translations.
However, this means that our screenshots will not look the same as the ones given in the instructions file.

We asked the TA's what could be the cause of the perspective-problem. We received as response that the parameters of the perspective function were not correct. We experimented with the parameters, but even with the supposedly correct values, aspect_ratio being a float derived from width/height and the near plane 0.1 and far plane 100, it did not work.
